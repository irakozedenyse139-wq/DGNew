## 1. Front Matter Details

### 1.1 Declaration
* Standard university declaration text affirming independent implementation.
* Attribution of third-party libraries: React Native, Expo, Axios, React Navigation / Expo Router, Cloudinary CDN, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI.

### 1.2 Acknowledgement
* Gratitude to course lecturer for guidance on modern mobile development and RESTful design.
* Recognition of the university environment, classmates for collaborative testing, and family for support.

### 1.3 Abstract
* **The Problem & Solution**: Online retail startup D&G in Rwamagana previously faced limited customer reach, manual telephone/WhatsApp order processing, and lack of real-time inventory and delivery tracking.
* **Architecture & Technologies**: Cross-platform application built on React Native 0.88 with Expo SDK 58, TypeScript 5.8+, React Context API with 0ms in-memory tab caching, Axios HTTP client with JWT Bearer interceptors, and a cloud FastAPI backend on Render with PostgreSQL.
* **Core Functions**:
  1. Secure JWT authentication (registration, login with password visibility toggle, forgot password, cascading account deletion).
  2. Multilingual product browsing with live category filtering, debounced search, RWF price tiers (<50k, 50k-150k, >150k RWF), and swipeable multi-image galleries.
  3. Shopping cart with quantity limits, subtotal calculations, and 2-step checkout supporting Rwandan delivery districts (Gasabo, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge, Rwamagana, etc.) and simulated Rwandan payment gateways (MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money, Bank Transfer).
  4. Real-time order tracking with a 5-second polling "Two-Way Delivery Handshake" synchronizing customers and store admins.
  5. Automated inventory control that decrements copy counts upon purchase and auto-deletes depleted items (`quantity <= 0`).
  6. Comprehensive reporting covering product listings, customer accounts, cart summaries, order logs, sales KPIs, and load performance.
* **Evaluation & Testing**: Rigorously validated with 0 TypeScript compilation errors (`tsc --noEmit`), full functional test matrix across Android emulators and physical devices, confirming fast page transitions, secure data isolation, and resilient offline/error feedback.
* **Keywords**: `React Native`, `Expo Router`, `e-commerce`, `FastAPI`, `PostgreSQL`, `Rwandan Franc (RWF)`, `Two-Way Delivery Handshake`, `REST API`, `Cloudinary`

## 2. Chapter 1: Introduction Details

### 1.1 Background
* **E-Commerce Growth**: Rapid digital transition in Sub-Saharan Africa, driven by 4G/5G smartphone penetration and ubiquitous mobile money infrastructure (e.g., MTN MoMo, Airtel Money).
* **Local Context (Rwanda)**: Rwanda’s cashless economy agenda and smart retail revolution.
* **Introduction to D&G**: Retail start-up in Rwamagana, Eastern Province, offering fashion and household goods:
  * Clothes (Men & Women apparel)
  * Shoes (Sneakers, formal footwear)
  * Bags (Handbags, backpacks)
  * Household Equipment (Kitchenware, small appliances)
  * Jewellery (Watches, necklaces, bracelets)
  * Cosmetics (Skincare, beauty products)

### 1.2 Problem Statement
* D&G operated through physical visits and informal social media messaging, leading to:
  * Inability to showcase real-time inventory counts, leading to customer disappointment when items run out.
  * Inefficient order coordination without structured delivery tracking.
  * Inconvenient currency and language barriers for international or non-English speaking shoppers.
  * Disconnected inventory where sold-out products remain visible.
* Solution: Cross-platform native mobile application (Android & iOS) connecting directly to a centralized REST API backend.

### 1.3 General Objective
> "To design, develop, test, and document a robust, secure, and user-friendly cross-platform e-commerce mobile application for D&G using React Native, TypeScript, and a FastAPI REST backend that allows customers to browse localized products, complete transactions in Rwandan Francs (RWF), and track orders through a live delivery handshake."

### 1.4 Specific Objectives
1. Implement isolated user authentication (register, login, password recovery, secure JWT token storage in AsyncStorage, cascading account deletion).
2. Develop a product browsing catalog with category filtering, debounced search, RWF price tiers, multi-image Cloudinary viewing, and instant 3-language switching (English, Kinyarwanda, French).
3. Build a persistent shopping cart with quantity controls, subtotal calculations, and a 2-step checkout with delivery routing and Rwandan payment simulation.
4. Implement a real-time order tracking module featuring a 5-second polling Two-Way Delivery Handshake.
5. Create an automated inventory control engine with live copy decrementing and automatic zero-stock item deletion.
6. Build an administrative control suite for product CRUD with multi-image gallery upload, customer delivery coordination, and executive sales analytics.
7. Conduct end-to-end testing across Android and iOS emulators verifying performance, security, and error handling.

## 5. Chapter 4: Implementation Details & Code Snippets

### 4.1 Project Setup
* Created using Expo SDK 58 and React Native 0.88 with TypeScript.
* Uses file-based Expo Router.
* Directory organization cleanly separates `components/`, `constants/`, `context/`, `screens/`, and `services/`.

### 4.2 Authentication Module
* **Token Storage**: Uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` under key `'user_token'`.
* **Axios Request Interceptor**: Automatically attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
* **Role Check**: Verifies `user.is_admin` to conditionally display customer vs admin interface.

#### 4.2.1 Code Snippet: Login & Interceptor Logic (`services/api.ts`)
```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const api = axios.create({
    baseURL: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://dgapp.onrender.com/api',
    timeout: 60000,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
});

// Automatic JWT Bearer injection
api.interceptors.request.use(async (config) => {
    const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user_token');
    if (token) {
        config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
}, (error) => Promise.reject(error));

export default api;
```

### 4.3 Product Browsing Module
* Category pills: `'All'`, `'Clothes'`, `'Shoes'`, `'Bags'`, `'Household'`, `'Jewelry'`, `'Cosmetics'`.
* Debounced search: 300ms delay to reduce unnecessary API calls.
* Price tiers: `'Under 50k RWF'`, `'50k-150k RWF'`, `'Over 150k RWF'`.

#### 4.3.1 Code Snippet: Product Filtering & Debounced Search (`CustomerSearch.tsx`)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    const delayDebounce = setTimeout(() => {
        fetchFilteredProducts();
    }, 300);
    return () => clearTimeout(delayDebounce);
}, [search]);

const filteredProducts = products.filter((p) => {
    const matchesCategory = selectedCategory === 'All' ||
        (p.category || '').toLowerCase() === selectedCategory.toLowerCase();
    const price = parseFloat(p.price || 0);
    let matchesPrice = true;
    if (selectedPriceFilter === 'Under 50k RWF') matchesPrice = price < 50000;
    else if (selectedPriceFilter === '50k-150k RWF') matchesPrice = price >= 50000 && price <= 150000;
    else if (selectedPriceFilter === 'Over 150k RWF') matchesPrice = price > 150000;
    return matchesCategory && matchesPrice;
});
```

### 4.4 Shopping Cart Module
* Synced both in React Context and in database via `api.put('/carts/')`.
* Automatically calculates total price in RWF.

#### 4.4.1 Code Snippet: Cart State & Backend Sync (`CartContext.tsx`)
```typescript
const syncCartWithBackend = async (newItems: any[]) => {
    const newTotal = newItems.reduce((acc, item) => acc + (item.price * item.quantity), 0);
    setCartItems(newItems);
    setTotalPrice(newTotal);
    try {
        await api.put('/carts/', { items: newItems, total_price: newTotal });
    } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to sync cart with server', e);
    }
};
```

### 4.5 Checkout & Inventory Decrement Module
* 2-Step checkout: Step 1 collects delivery details; Step 2 handles payment.
* Auto-decrement and zero-stock auto-delete implemented in backend `crud_order.py`.

#### 4.5.1 Code Snippet: Backend Stock Decrement & Auto-Delete (`crud_order.py`)
```python
# Decrement quantities and delete product if copies run out (quantity <= 0)
if order_data.items and isinstance(order_data.items, list):
    for item in order_data.items:
        if not isinstance(item, dict) or item.get('is_customer_info'):
            continue
        prod_id = item.get('product_id') or item.get('id')
        qty = int(item.get('quantity') or 1)
        if prod_id:
            product = db.query(Product).filter(Product.id == str(prod_id)).first()
            if product:
                new_qty = (product.quantity or 0) - qty
                if new_qty <= 0:
                    db.delete(product)
                else:
                    product.quantity = new_qty
db.commit()
```

### 4.6 Two-Way Delivery Handshake Module
* 5-second polling interval (`POLL_INTERVAL_MS = 5000`).
* Optimistic UI update in 0ms when customer or admin confirms receipt.

#### 4.6.1 Code Snippet: Handshake Receipt Confirmation (`CustomerOrders.tsx`)
```typescript
const handleCustomerConfirmReceipt = async (order: any) => {
    // Optimistically mark as delivered in a blink
    setOrders((prev) => prev.map((o) => (o.id === order.id ? { ...o, delivered: true } : o)));
    try {
        await api.patch(`/orders/${order.id}/deliver`);
        Alert.alert('🎉 Success', 'Delivery confirmed! Thank you for shopping with D&G.');
    } catch (e) {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Could not confirm delivery with server.');
    }
};
```

### 4.7 Multi-Language Support (`i18n.ts` & `LanguageContext.tsx`)
* Centralized translations dictionary supporting English, Kinyarwanda, and French.
* Standardized `formatRWF(amount)` helper.

#### 4.7.1 Code Snippet: Rwandan Currency Formatter (`i18n.ts`)
```typescript
export function formatRWF(amount: number): string {
    if (isNaN(amount) || amount === null || amount === undefined) {
        return 'RWF 0';
    }
    return `RWF ${Math.round(amount).toLocaleString('en-US')}`;
}
```

### 4.8 Cloudinary Multi-Image Upload (`imageService.ts`)
* Uses Cloudinary unsigned upload preset `DGAppImages`.
* Supports both Base64 JSON (rock-solid on Android) and multipart `FormData`.

#### 4.8.1 Code Snippet: Cloudinary Upload Engine (`imageService.ts`)
```typescript
export async function uploadImageToCloudinary(input: string | ImageUploadInput): Promise<string | null> {
    const CLOUD_NAME = "b2h01eeh";
    const UPLOAD_PRESET = "DGAppImages";
    // Base64 upload to bypass Android multipart boundary bugs
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${CLOUD_NAME}/image/upload`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            file: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${input.base64}`,
            upload_preset: UPLOAD_PRESET,
        }),
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    return result.secure_url || null;
}
```

### 4.9 State Management Architecture (Table 8)

| State Context | State Variables Held | Primary Actions & Handlers | Persistence Layer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`AuthContext`** | `user`, `token`, `isLoading` | `login()`, `register()`, `logout()`, `deleteAccount()` | `AsyncStorage` (`user_token`) + Backend `/users/me` |
| **`CartContext`** | `cartItems`, `totalPrice` | `addToCart()`, `updateQuantity()`, `clearCart()`, `fetchCart()` | Backend `/api/carts/` + In-memory Context |
| **`LanguageContext`**| `lang` (`'en'\|'rw'\|'fr'`), `t` | `setLang(newLang)` | React Context + In-memory |
| **Tab In-Memory Caches**| `cachedProducts`, `cachedOrders`, `cachedStats` | Silent background synchronization | Module memory (0ms zero-spinner tab switching) |

---

## 6. Chapter 5: Reports Generated by the System Details

### 5.1 Product Listing Report (Figure 22)
* **Description**: Catalog report generated from `GET /api/products/` and displayed in `AdminProductsCrud.tsx`.
* **Columns / Metrics**: Product Name, Category, Unit Price in RWF, Available Stock Quantity (`#Items`), Image Count Badge, Low Stock Pill (`Only X left!`).
* **Visual Display**: Structured table cards with thumbnail image, edit button, and delete trigger.

### 5.2 Customer Information Report (Figure 23)
* **Description**: Detailed customer transaction report extracted from order metadata in `AdminConfirmOrders.tsx`.
* **Data Fields**: Customer Full Name, Account Email, Primary Phone Number, WhatsApp Number, Delivery District (e.g., Gasabo), Specific Delivery Address, Selected Payment Channel, Order Reference code.

### 5.3 Cart Summary Report (Figure 24)
* **Description**: Pre-checkout customer item breakdown generated in `CustomerCart.tsx`.
* **Data Fields**: List of selected product items with thumbnail preview, unit price in RWF, quantity selector stepper (`-`, count, `+`), item subtotal, and highlighted bottom checkout bar displaying total payable RWF.

### 5.4 Order History Report (Figure 25)

## 7. Chapter 6: Challenges and Solutions (Table 9)

| Challenge Encountered | Root Cause | Implemented Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Android Soft Navigation Inset Clipping** | On Android devices with on-screen back/home buttons, fixed tab bar heights resulted in icons being covered. | Implemented dynamic safe-area insets using `useSafeAreaInsets()` in `_layout.tsx`, dynamically calculating bottom padding (`tabHeight = 54 + insets.bottom`). |
| **Android Cloudinary Multipart Upload Boundary Errors** | Standard `FormData` file uploads on React Native Android often fail when custom `Content-Type` headers strip auto-generated multipart boundaries. | Added Base64 image payload upload support in `imageService.ts`, sending direct base64 strings to Cloudinary API to guarantee 100% upload reliability. |
| **Inventory Overselling & Depleted Stock Visibility** | When customers purchase the last available item, displaying sold-out items clutters the catalog. | Implemented automated stock decrement in `crud_order.py` with immediate auto-deletion (`if new_qty <= 0: db.delete(product)`), paired with client-side stock pre-validation in `checkout.tsx`. |
| **Delivery Status Desynchronization** | Customers would see persistent "In Transit" alerts even after physical delivery, while admins lacked proof of delivery. | Developed the Two-Way Delivery Handshake with a 5-second polling heartbeat and 0ms optimistic UI dismissals, synchronizing customer and admin interfaces. |
| **Tab Navigation Loading Spinners** | Switching between tabs caused blank loading spinners on every transition, harming user experience. | Engineered an in-memory module caching layer (`cachedProducts`, `cachedOrders`) that renders previously fetched data in 0ms while silently verifying updates in the background. |
| **Account Deletion Credential Leakage** | Allowing account deletion without re-authentication poses a security risk if an unlocked phone is accessed. | Implemented a dedicated security modal in `profile.tsx` requiring password and email confirmation, verifying credentials via `/auth/login` before issuing cascade delete commands. |
